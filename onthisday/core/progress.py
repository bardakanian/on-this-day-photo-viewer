"""Time-left estimates for long background jobs (scans, saving previews). Kept free of Qt so it can be tested.

Progress comes in bursts: cached files fly by, then a HEIC photo or a video takes a while. A rate
taken over a moment swings with every burst, so the estimate here uses the rate over the last
minute blended with the rate since the start, and the shown figure counts down steadily, only
jumping when the new estimate is clearly different.
